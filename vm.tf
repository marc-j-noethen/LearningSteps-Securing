  # Built from static values (server name is deterministic:

  # azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server.main.fqdn directly. Found by testing
  # (Day 3's practice DB recreate, `terraform apply -replace=...postgresql_flexible_server.main`):
  # referencing the live resource's computed .fqdn attribute here means ANY
  # replacement of the PostgreSQL server — including the exact "destroy and
  # recreate" operation Day 3 has students practice — makes custom_data
  # "known after apply" and forces the VM itself to be destroyed and
  # recreated too, wiping every bit of Day 1/2/4/5's manually-configured
  # state (NPMplus, oauth2-proxy, CrowdSec — none of which are reprovisioned
  # by cloud-init, only by deploy.py's one-time SSH setup scripts). Confirmed
  # live: after a DB-only `-replace`, the VM's SSH host key changed and
  # Docker/NPMplus/oauth2-proxy were gone entirely. Using a statically
  # derivable FQDN removes the dependency edge, so replacing the database
  # server no longer forces a VM replacement.

  # Explicit ordering only (cloud-init's runcmd already retries the DB
  # connection until it succeeds) — keeps "DB should exist before the VM
  # tries to use it" predictable without coupling custom_data to a
  # computed attribute. The firewall rule matters here too: at baseline
  # the DB is public (Day 4 migrates it to Private Link), and a public
  # Flexible Server still denies all connections — including from the VM
  # itself — until a firewall rule permits them. Without this, Terraform
  # can create the VM (and cloud-init's DB setup can start) before the
  # firewall rule exists, causing a real, confirmed-live race: cloud-init's
  # own retry loop eventually connects and creates the table, but
  # deploy.py's separate seeding step (running moments later) can still
  # lose that race and find the table gone.
