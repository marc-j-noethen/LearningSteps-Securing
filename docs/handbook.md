# LearningSteps Lockdown — Course Handbook

A five-day hands-on security course. Each day, you harden one layer of a
shared web application (LearningSteps: a FastAPI + PostgreSQL app deployed on
Azure via Terraform). By the end of the week, the app is protected end to
end: locked-down management access, identity-based authentication, an
isolated database, encrypted traffic with a web application firewall, and
automated attack detection and response.

Deploy the environment once at the start of the week:

```
python3 deploy.py --password <db-password> --prefix <your-name> --location westeurope
```

This provisions the VM, database, networking, and monitoring stack, and
installs the baseline software used across the week (NPMplus, CrowdSec,
oauth2-proxy). **Wait time: 10-15 minutes** — a good point to start the
day's lecture content while it finishes.

---

## Day 1 — Locking Down Management Access

**Goal**: replace static SSH keys with identity-based login, and restrict
network access to your VM's management port.

Right now, anything on the internet can attempt to brute-force SSH on your
VM. Today you close that door two ways: authenticate with your Entra ID
identity instead of a key file, and restrict the network path to a trusted
IP entirely.

### Demo 1 — Entra ID SSH Login

1. Confirm you have the **Virtual Machine Administrator Login** role on the
   VM. This role is assigned scoped to the VM resource (not the
   subscription), so `az role assignment list` needs an explicit `--scope`
   pointing at the VM — without it, the command silently returns an empty
   list even when the role is correctly assigned:
   ```
   VM_ID=$(az vm show --resource-group <rg> --name <vm-name> --query id -o tsv)
   az role assignment list --assignee <your-email> \
     --role "Virtual Machine Administrator Login" --scope "$VM_ID"
   ```
2. Log in with Entra ID — no key file involved:
   ```
   az ssh vm --resource-group <rg> --name <vm-name>
   ```

### Demo 2 — Restrict SSH to a Trusted IP

Open `network.tf` and restrict the `allow-ssh` rule's
`source_address_prefix` from `"*"` to your own IP:
```
curl -s ifconfig.me
```
Update the rule, then `terraform apply` (**wait time: under a minute**). The
change takes effect immediately — a connection from any other IP will now
be refused.

### Troubleshooting

- **`az ssh` fails with "AuthorizationFailed"**: you need Owner or User
  Access Administrator on the subscription to grant yourself the "Virtual
  Machine Administrator Login" role. Ask whoever manages the subscription to
  run:
  ```
  az role assignment create --assignee <your-email> \
    --role "Virtual Machine Administrator Login" \
    --scope <vm-resource-id>
  ```

---

## Day 2 — Identity-Based API Access

**Goal**: require a valid Entra ID identity token before any request reaches
the application, replacing anonymous access to the API.

Anyone who can reach the VM's app port can currently read, write, or delete
data with no accountability. Today you put an identity gate in front of it —
this is the same "static credential vs. identity" upgrade as Day 1, applied
to the application layer instead of SSH.

### Demo 1 — Access the NPMplus Admin Panel

Open an SSH tunnel to the NPMplus admin panel (its GUI is deliberately not
exposed to the internet — same principle as Day 1's SSH lockdown):
```
ssh -i .learningsteps_key -L 8081:localhost:81 azureuser@<vm-ip>
```
Browse to `https://localhost:8081` and log in.

### Demo 2 — Create the Proxy Host

Create a Proxy Host for the app: domain = your VM's FQDN, forward to
`127.0.0.1:8000`. Leave TLS off for now — that's Day 4.

Via API instead of the GUI:
```bash
curl -sk -c npm.cookies -X POST https://localhost:8081/api/tokens \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"identity":"admin@learningsteps.local","secret":"LearningSteps123!"}'

curl -sk -X POST https://localhost:8081/api/nginx/proxy-hosts \
  -b npm.cookies -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain_names":["<domain>"],"forward_scheme":"http","forward_host":"127.0.0.1","forward_port":8000,"locations":[]}'
```
The `"locations": []` field must be included explicitly — omitting it
breaks the Auth Request step later on.

### Demo 3 — Register an Entra ID Application

```
APP_ID=$(az ad app create --display-name learningsteps-oauth2-proxy \
    --sign-in-audience AzureADMyOrg \
    --query appId -o tsv)
az ad app update --id $APP_ID --identifier-uris api://$APP_ID
az ad sp create --id $APP_ID
SECRET=$(az ad app credential reset --id $APP_ID --query password -o tsv)
TENANT_ID=$(az account show --query tenantId -o tsv)
```
`az ad app create` only creates the Application object — it does **not**
create a Service Principal, and without one the app can't act as a
sign-in/token audience in this tenant at all (`az ad sp show --id $APP_ID`
404s until you run `az ad sp create`).

Also required — force v2.0-format access tokens for this app:
```
OBJECT_ID=$(az ad app show --id $APP_ID --query id -o tsv)
az rest --method PATCH --uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/$OBJECT_ID" \
  --body '{"api":{"requestedAccessTokenVersion":2}}'
```
Without this, `az account get-access-token --resource api://$APP_ID` (used
in Demo 6 below) issues a **v1.0-format** token
(`"iss": "https://sts.windows.net/<tenant>/"`, `"ver": "1.0"`) by default.
oauth2-proxy is configured with the v2.0 issuer URL
(`https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0`) and rejects a v1.0
token outright. This is unrelated to `OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_EXTRA_AUDIENCES` or
`SKIP_JWT_BEARER_TOKENS` — both can be configured correctly and the
bearer-token test in Demo 6 will still fail without this token-version fix.

**Wait time**: allow a minute after `az ad sp create` before testing tokens
— Entra ID directory replication can lag briefly for a brand-new Service
Principal.

### Demo 4 — Configure and Start oauth2-proxy

On the VM, fill in `/etc/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy.env`:
```
OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID=$APP_ID
OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET=$SECRET
OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/$TENANT_ID/v2.0
OAUTH2_PROXY_OIDC_EXTRA_AUDIENCES=api://$APP_ID
```
Set `--redirect-url=https://<domain>/oauth2/callback` in
`/etc/systemd/system/oauth2-proxy.service`, then:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now oauth2-proxy
```

### Demo 5 — Wire Identity Enforcement into NPMplus

In the NPMplus GUI, open the Proxy Host's **Auth Request** tab, select
**oauth2proxy**, and save. This wires identity enforcement in front of the
app with no application code changes and no hand-written proxy config —
worth opening the generated nginx config on the VM afterward to see what the
dropdown just built for you.

Via API instead — the field is `npmplus_auth_request` on the proxy host
object (`"none"`, `"oauth2proxy"`, and a handful of other supported auth
backends), and the upstream it points at is already fixed by
`AUTH_REQUEST_OAUTH2PROXY_UPSTREAM` (set on the NPMplus container by
`setup-npmplus.sh`), so a single PUT is enough:
```bash
curl -sk -X PUT https://localhost:8081/api/nginx/proxy-hosts/<id> \
  -b npm.cookies -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"npmplus_auth_request":"oauth2proxy"}'
```

### Demo 6 — Test the Identity Gate

- `curl -i http://<domain>/` → redirected to Microsoft sign-in
  (unauthenticated).
- `curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer garbage" http://<domain>/` → also
  redirected (a malformed token doesn't get a free pass).
- Visit `https://<domain>/` in a browser, complete the Microsoft login, land
  on the app with a valid session.
- To verify the full identity check without a browser (useful for
  scripting/grading), get a real Entra ID token scoped to the app and send
  it directly:
  ```bash
  TOKEN=$(az account get-access-token --tenant $TENANT_ID \
    --resource api://$APP_ID --query accessToken -o tsv)
  curl -i http://<domain>/entries -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
  ```
  This should return `200` with no browser redirect — oauth2-proxy validates
  the bearer token directly against Entra ID's signing keys. The **first**
  time you run this `az account get-access-token` command for this
  resource, Azure CLI may open a browser for a one-time consent prompt
  ("learningsteps-oauth2-proxy wants access to your data") — this is normal
  incremental consent for a new app+resource+user combination, not an
  error; approve it once and subsequent calls are silent. (This is separate
  from — and does not replace — the `api.requestedAccessTokenVersion` fix
  in Demo 3, which is required regardless of consent.)

### Troubleshooting

- **No `identifier-uri add` subcommand**: use
  `az ad app update --id $APP_ID --identifier-uris api://$APP_ID`.
- **NPMplus admin panel returns "Permission Denied" shortly after a
  restart**: log in again to get a fresh session — this doesn't mean your
  configuration was lost.

## Day 3 — Data Isolation

**Goal**: understand why the database has no public IP at all (Azure Private
Link — reachable only from inside the virtual network), and practice a safe,
backup-first migration by recreating it.

**Note on this baseline**: unlike Day 2 and Day 4 (where the software is
pre-installed but left *unwired* for the live demo), `postgresql.tf` already
deploys the database fully private — delegated subnet, private DNS zone,
`public_network_access_enabled = false` — from the very first
`python3 deploy.py` run at the start of the week. There is no earlier
"public database" phase to migrate away from; `terraform apply` against an
unmodified `postgresql.tf` at this point in the course is a no-op. The goal
of this exercise is thus **why** the database is architected this way, and
giving you a real, disruptive backup-then-recreate to practice on — not
walking a live public→private transition that doesn't exist in this repo's
baseline.

### Demo 1 — Back Up the Database

Back up the current database **via the VM** (the DB has no public IP, so the
dump has to run over SSH, not directly from your laptop) and pull the result
down to your own machine — don't leave your only copy on the VM:
```
ssh -i .learningsteps_key azureuser@<vm-ip> \
  'pg_dump "postgresql://psqladmin@<db-fqdn>/learning_journal?sslmode=require"' \
  > learningsteps_backup.sql
```
Confirm the file is non-empty and contains real table data before
proceeding — there's no undo once the next step runs. Pulling it to your
laptop (rather than leaving it in `/tmp` on the VM) matters here: a bad
Day 3 practice run can end up recreating more than just the database (see
Demo 2's callout), so treat the VM as disposable too.

**Prerequisite**: the VM's default `postgresql-client` package (Ubuntu
22.04) is v14, but the server runs PostgreSQL 16 — `pg_dump` refuses to dump
a *newer* major server version ("aborting because of server version
mismatch"). `scripts/cloud-init.yaml` installs `postgresql-client-16` from
the PGDG apt repo instead of the distro default; confirm with
`pg_dump --version` before proceeding if in doubt.

### Demo 2 — Recreate the Database (Backup-First Practice)

Force a destroy-and-recreate of the database server, to practice the
backup-first discipline on a real (not hypothetical) operation:
```
terraform apply -replace="azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server.main"
```
This destroys and recreates the same (already-private) server. **Wait time:
5-8 minutes**, during which the app on the VM cannot reach the database at
all.

**A serious interaction to know about, already fixed in this repo**:
`vm.tf`'s `custom_data` used to interpolate
`azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server.main.fqdn` directly. Replacing the
database resource made that value "known after apply," which — because any
`custom_data` change forces VM replacement — cascaded into destroying and
recreating **the entire VM** too, wiping Docker/NPMplus/CrowdSec/oauth2-proxy
completely (none of that is reprovisioned by cloud-init — only by
`deploy.py`'s one-time SSH setup scripts). `vm.tf` now builds the connection
string from the statically-known server name
(`psql-${var.prefix}.postgres.database.azure.com`) instead of the live
resource attribute, removing that dependency — a database-only `-replace`
now leaves the VM untouched.

### Demo 3 — Restore and Verify Isolation

Restore from the VM (the only machine that can reach the database):
```
scp -i .learningsteps_key learningsteps_backup.sql azureuser@<vm-ip>:/tmp/
ssh -i .learningsteps_key azureuser@<vm-ip> \
  "psql \"<connection-string>\" -f /tmp/learningsteps_backup.sql"
```

Verify the lockdown: a connection attempt from your laptop should fail to
resolve the database's hostname at all, while the app (running on the VM,
inside the same virtual network) keeps working normally once restored.

### Demo 4 — Confirm the App Recovered

Check that the app is actually serving data again, not just that the server
exists:
```
curl -s https://<domain>/entries -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
If this still fails after the restore, restart the API service to force a
fresh DNS resolution and connection:
```
ssh -i .learningsteps_key azureuser@<vm-ip> "sudo systemctl restart learningsteps"
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Database connection times out from your laptop after the migration** —
  this is expected. Your laptop is outside the virtual network and has no
  route to the private address space; only resources inside the VNet (like
  the VM) can reach it.
- **`terraform apply` (with no `-replace`) reports no changes** — this is
  expected in this baseline; see the note above. Use `-replace` to force
  the practice recreate.

## Day 4 — Encryption and a Web Application Firewall

**Goal**: encrypt all traffic and add a web application firewall that blocks
known attack patterns.

Two gaps remain: traffic is still plaintext, and nothing inspects what's
actually being sent to the API. Today you close both — first with real TLS,
then with a WAF that blocks SQL injection and XSS payloads before they reach
the application.

### Demo 1 — Confirm the Unencrypted Gap

With the Proxy Host from Day 2 still running without TLS, request it over
plain HTTP and note the response is fully readable in transit — an open
port is not the same thing as an encrypted connection.

### Demo 2 — Enable Real TLS

In the NPMplus GUI, open the Proxy Host's SSL tab, choose "Request a new SSL
Certificate," select Let's Encrypt, and save. NPMplus handles the
domain-verification challenge and certificate storage automatically.
**Wait time: well under a minute** for issuance. Confirm:
```
curl -i https://<domain>/entries
```
returns a valid, browser-trusted certificate, and that plain HTTP now
redirects to HTTPS.

Via API instead:
```bash
CERT_ID=$(curl -sk -X POST https://localhost:8081/api/nginx/certificates \
  -b npm.cookies -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider":"letsencrypt","domain_names":["<domain>"],"meta":{"dns_challenge":false}}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['id'])")

curl -sk -X PUT https://localhost:8081/api/nginx/proxy-hosts/<id> \
  -b npm.cookies -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"certificate_id\":$CERT_ID,\"ssl_forced\":true}"
```

### Demo 3 — Enable the Web Application Firewall

First show the gap: send known attack payloads and note they pass straight
through:
```
curl -i "https://<domain>/entries?id=1+UNION+SELECT+*+FROM+users"
curl -i "https://<domain>/entries?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C%2Fscript%3E"
```

Enable the WAF (CrowdSec, running the OWASP Core Rule Set):
```
docker exec crowdsec cscli bouncers add npmplus
# copy the printed API key immediately — it's shown once
sudo nano /opt/npmplus/crowdsec/crowdsec.conf
#   ENABLED=true
#   API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
#   APPSEC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7422
#   API_KEY=<paste key>
cd /opt/npmplus && docker compose restart npmplus
```
**Wait time: 1-2 minutes** for the container restart.

Re-send the same payloads — both now return `403`. Inspect the block with:
```
docker exec crowdsec cscli alerts list
```

**Important — test this authenticated.** Since Day 2's identity check runs
before the WAF check on the same path, an unauthenticated attack request
gets redirected to the login page rather than reaching the WAF at all — so
it won't show a `403`. To see the WAF in action, attach a valid identity to
the request first — either a browser session cookie, or the same bearer
token approach from Day 2:
```bash
curl -i "https://<domain>/entries?id=1+UNION+SELECT+*+FROM+users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```
This is a good discussion point: the WAF is still protecting you, just
against attackers who already have (or stole) a valid session — arguably
the more realistic threat.

**A note worth mentioning out loud**: CrowdSec shares detected attack
signals with its community threat-intel blocklist by default. Check
`cscli console status`, and `cscli console disable` to opt out. Worth
raising as a "read the fine print on security tools" moment regardless of
which way the class decides to leave it.

### Troubleshooting

- **NPMplus's own admin panel starts returning 403s after enabling the
  WAF**: the WAF protects the entire proxy instance, including NPMplus's own
  admin interface. Temporarily set `ENABLED=false` in
  `/opt/npmplus/crowdsec/crowdsec.conf` to make further admin changes, then
  re-enable.
- **A previously-blocked IP still gets 403'd on a clean request**: after
  enough attack attempts, CrowdSec may issue a longer-lived ban for that IP
  (`docker exec crowdsec cscli decisions list`), independent of any single
  request's content. This is expected — the IP is banned outright, not
  still being flagged request-by-request.

---

## Day 5 — Visibility and Automated Response

**Goal**: ship logs to a central security platform, detect an attack
pattern automatically, and respond to it without a human in the loop.

Every layer built so far is a static defense. Today closes the loop: traffic
logs flow into Microsoft Sentinel, an analytics rule watches for attack
patterns, and — when one fires — a Logic App automatically blocks the
attacker at the network level.

### Demo 1 — Confirm Log Forwarding

Confirm the log forwarder is running on the VM:
```
sudo systemctl status npmplus-log-forwarder --no-pager
```
Generate some traffic and confirm it's captured locally first — this is the
fastest way to debug anything that doesn't show up later in Sentinel:
```
curl -s https://<domain>/entries >/dev/null
journalctl -t nginx --since '1 min ago'
```

### Demo 2 — Validate Log Ingestion

Confirm the logs are landing in Log Analytics. **Wait time: 3-5 minutes**
after first traffic:
```kql
Syslog | where ProcessName == "nginx" | take 5
```

### Demo 3 — Run the Attack Simulation

Fire the "Final Test" attack simulation with a valid authenticated session
(see Day 4's note on why):
```
for i in $(seq 1 6); do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
    "https://<domain>/entries?id=1+UNION+SELECT+*+FROM+users" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
done
```
All six should return `403` (the WAF must already be enabled from Day 4).

### Demo 4 — Validate the Detection Query

Run the detection query directly, before waiting on the scheduled rule:
```kql
Syslog
| where ProcessName == "nginx"
| extend log = parse_json(SyslogMessage)
| extend StatusCode = toint(log.status)
| extend ClientIP   = tostring(log.remote_addr)
| where StatusCode == 403
| summarize WafBlocks = count() by ClientIP
| where WafBlocks >= 5
```

### Demo 5 — Wait for the Automated Incident

**Wait time: up to 5 minutes** (the analytics rule runs on a 5-minute
schedule). Check **Sentinel → Incidents** for "WAF Attack — High Volume
403s from Single IP."

### Demo 6 — Verify the Automated Block

Confirm the automation rule triggered the response playbook, and — this is
the part that actually matters — **verify the block works, not just that a
rule was created**. **Wait time: roughly another minute** after the
incident appears, for the Logic App to run:
```
az network nsg rule list --resource-group <rg> --nsg-name nsg-<prefix> -o table
```
Then confirm from the attacking IP that `curl`/`ssh` to the VM now time out
at the network level (not just return an app-level error). A rule existing
and a rule actually blocking traffic are two different claims — always
check both.

### Troubleshooting

- **Nothing appears in Sentinel after several minutes**: validate the raw
  KQL query manually first (Demo 4) — if it returns rows, the scheduled
  rule will fire on its next 5-minute cycle; if it returns nothing, the
  problem is upstream of Sentinel (check Demo 1's local log output first).
- **A retest right after a successful block seems to fail strangely**: check
  `docker exec crowdsec cscli decisions list` — the attacking IP may already
  be under a longer CrowdSec ban independent of the NSG rule, which will
  make all its requests fail rather than just the malicious-looking ones.
